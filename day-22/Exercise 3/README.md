# 3PillarGlobal-JavaScript-Exercise3
Internship Assignment Exercise (Completed)<br>
This project is hosted live [here](http://priyankasaini.rf.gd/3pillarglobal/exercise3-day22/)

## Task
In this Assignment Exercise 3, I was tasked to create a web page that looks similar to the one shown [here](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/22_Day_Manipulating_DOM_object/22_day_manipulating_DOM_object.md#exercises).
The whole page has to be created using JavaScript with minimal or no HTML, CSS.

## Key Features
The whole page is based on the implementation of JavaScripts DOM.
